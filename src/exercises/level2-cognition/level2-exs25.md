### Exercise 25

Q: Compare the addresses of the same variable between different executions.


A: 
Running the code from exercise 23 multiple times we can observe the following:
- There is some variation in the adresses assigned, i.e. the address is not consisted between runs.
- We seem to prefer "low" memory adresses, as signified by the consistend leading 0s in the adresses. This indicates that memory grows "upwards".
