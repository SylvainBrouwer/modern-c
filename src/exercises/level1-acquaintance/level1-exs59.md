### Exercise 59

Q: The second return of hexatridecimal makes an assumption about the relation between a and 'A'. What is it?

A: 
It assumes the character engocings for uppercase characters are contiguous and in order, such that `a >= 'A'`. 
We have asserted this for lowercase characters, but not uppercase.
