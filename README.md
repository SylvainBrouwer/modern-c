### Modern C: Exercises & Challenges
This is based on the 2nd edition (minor rev. 2) of Modern C by Jens Gustedt.

### Notes
The book numbers exercises accoring to the footnote number, this leads to inconsistent numbering as non-exercise footnotes result in numbers being skipped.
I will provide an overview of skipped numbers (and other notes) here.

Level 0: Encounter
- Exercises 1, 2, 4, and 8 do not exist.

Level 1: Acquaintance
- Exercises 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20, 29, 37, 38, 39, 40, 44, and 58 do not exist.
