### Modern C: Exercises & Challenges
This is based on the 2nd edition (minor rev. 2) of Modern C by Jens Gustedt.

### Notes
The book numbers exercises accoring to the footnote number, this leads to inconsistent numbering as non-exercise footnotes result in numbers being skipped.
I will provide an overview of skipped numbers (and other notes) here.
